# Customer Churn Prediction

This project predicts customer churn using the Telco Customer dataset. I built and evaluated classification models, explored feature importance, and interpreted model results to provide business insights.

## 🧠 Objectives
- Predict if a customer will churn using historical data
- Identify which features are most responsible for churn
- Build interpretable and actionable machine learning models

## ⚙️ Tools & Technologies
- Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn
- Random Forest, Logistic Regression
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- SHAP (optional), Feature Importance

## 📊 Key Insights
- `Contract_Two year` and `MonthlyCharges` are the strongest indicators of churn
- Random Forest achieved >80% accuracy
- Feature importance helped interpret model decisions and support business strategies

## 📁 Dataset
[Kaggle: Telco Customer Churn](https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn)

## ✅ Future Improvements
- Deploy model with Streamlit
- Integrate SHAP/Explainable AI visualization
- Try advanced models like XGBoost or LightGBM
